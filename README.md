intro2python-coursera
=====================

My first steps
I took an intro to python course with PyLadies DC, and it was a whirlwind of information and I don't think that I was able to retain much except the idea that I should give it more time and energy. I tried working through Think Python and got stuck with swampy and bailed. Then I got a second wind after a few months, and got back in track with coursera and codeacademy just to get a refresher. Now I'm doing the Rice University coursera class and this would be a good place to start learning how to post code and share it. Perhaps in a few months I'll look back and see all my progress!
